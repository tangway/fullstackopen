## 0.4: New note diagram
Create a similar diagram depicting the situation where the user creates a new note on the page https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/notes by writing something into the text field and clicking the Save button.

If necessary, show operations on the browser or on the server as comments on the diagram.

The diagram does not have to be a sequence diagram. Any sensible way of presenting the events is fine.
